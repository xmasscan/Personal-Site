For the longest time, I've been meaning to dip my toes in the development of a professional site, one where I could provide the world an easily accessible avenue to learn about me, whether it be as simple as establishing contact, or being able to peer into my thoughts, so to speak.

This meant that the following had to be true about my website:
- It had to be simple to navigate, and not require great power to access and render.
- It had to look simple, while still being visually pleasing, to visually convey my admiration of both effiency and usability.
- It had to allow me to explain my projects, thought processes, and thoughts without requiring I write a new page of HTML every single time I did.
- It had to be easy to maintain. I do not want my simple little website to break if someone decides to [delete left-pad](https://qz.com/646467/how-one-programmer-broke-the-internet-by-deleting-a-tiny-piece-of-code)
